These are scripts that are not actually necessary for the patcher but which may be useful for patch users, for other patch developers, etc.
The configureOS.sh script has been found on macrumors (have to search the download link and give credits to the author) and modified to generate the various config files for AMD, NVIDIA cards, for Big Sur installation (INSTALL) and for unmodified iMac systems (OTHER). 
It is still under development!
